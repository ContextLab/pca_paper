# Generating figures and statistical results for this project

Follow the [setup instructions]() before running the project code.

Running the notebooks in this folder will produce all of the figures and statistical results
reported in the [main paper](https://github.com/ContextLab/pca_paper/blob/master/paper/main.pdf) and [supplement](https://github.com/ContextLab/pca_paper/blob/master/paper/supplement.pdf), as follows:

- Figure 1: pie_images.ipynb
- Figure 2: decoding_and_compression.ipynb
- Figure 3: decoding_and_compression.ipynb
- Figure 4: network_analyses.ipynb
- Figure 5: neurosynth.ipynb
- Figure 6: neurosynth.ipynb
- Table S1: neurosynth.ipynb
- Table S2: neurosynth.ipynb
- Figure S1: decoding_and_compression.ipynb
- Figure S2: neurosynth.ipynb
- Figure S3: neurosynth.ipynb
- Figure S4: neurosynth.ipynb
- Figure S5: neurosynth.ipynb

Most of the statistical results reported in the main text are generated in decoding_and_compression.ipynb.  Where needed, each notebook will also download any data needed for the notebook's analyses.  Downloaded files will be stored in the `data` folder and sub-folders.
