% \caption{\textbf{Top terms associated with the highest-weighted components by
% condition, broken down by story segment.} Each group of three rows corresponds
% to an experimental condition, and the colors correspond to the component number
% (ranked by proportion of variance explained). The rows' numbering denotes the
% story segment used to compute each map (1: first third; 2: second third; 3:
% third third). The inflated brain plots display the top 20 highest-weighted hubs
% (see \textit{Topographic Factor Analysis}) for each components. The lists on
% the right display the top five Neurosynth terms~\citep{RubiEtal17} decoded from
% each components' brain map. Analogous maps computed for the entire story may be
% found in Figure~\synth.}

\caption{\vspace{0.2cm} \normalsize \noindent Table S1: \textbf{Neurosynth-derived topics.} We report the top-weighted terms
for each of 80 topics identified using Latent Dirichlet
Allocation~\citep{BleiEtal03} applied to 9,204 functional neuroimaging articles
in the Neurosynth database~\citep{RubiEtal17}. The topics, as well as
associated brain maps identified using Neurosynth, were identified and reported
in several prior studies~\citep{FoxEtal14, SulEtal17, ChenEtal20}. The topic
labels for each topic were generated automatically with the following ChatGPT
(chat.openai.com) prompt: ``Please help me come up with intuitive labels for
topic topics I found by fitting a topic model to thousands of neuroscience and
psychology articles. I'll paste in the top 10 highest-weighted words for each
topic, and I'd like you to respond with a suggested label. For each topic,
please respond with just the topic label and no other formatting or text. Here
are the next topic's top words:'' followed by a comma-separated list of the
given topic's top-weighted words reflected in the table. For some topics,
ChatGPT responded with a longer-form response rather than a concise topic
label. In these instances, on a case-by-case basis, we used a second follow-up
prompt to achieve the given topic's label: ``could you please come up with a
more concise label for that topic?''. We then manually identified a set of 11
cognitive labels that were intended to encapsulate a representative range of
widely studied low-level and high-level cognitive functions. In choosing the
set of cognitive labels, we jointly considered each topic's ChatGPT-derived
topic label, along with the top-weighted words for the topic. We attempted to
generate a concise set of labels that still spanned the full set of cognitive
functions reflected across the 80 topics. Topics that appeared unrelated to
specific cognitive functions (e.g., topics related to specific methods or
clinical themes) are designated with dashes.

condition, broken down by story segment.} Each group of five rows corresponds
to an experimental condition (denoted by color, as indicated in the legend in
the lower right), and the columns and shading correspond to the component
number (ranked by proportion of variance explained). The colored squares in
front of many of the topics denote manually identified cognitive labels
(Tab.~S1).}
